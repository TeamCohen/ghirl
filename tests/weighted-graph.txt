#create a minorthird 'labels' node that annotates the single file
#msg2.txt.  This will incidentally create some additional nodes
#associated with the annotations. For implementation reasons: in the
#labels.txt file, the documentId argument is always replaced by the
#string 'somefile' (note that the file annotated is specified below).
