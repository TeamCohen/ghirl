#create some 'text' nodes, which contain small strings of text
node TEXT$m3ac modules for inferring names and ontological relationships etc

#create some FILE nodes. the file names could 
#be paths here.
node FILE$msg1.txt

#create some relationships involving files
edge authored josh FILE$msg1.txt 1

edge authored william FILE$msg3.txt 1

#create a minorthird 'labels' node that annotates the single file
#msg2.txt.  This will incidentally create some additional nodes
#associated with the annotations. For implementation reasons: in the
#labels.txt file, the documentId argument is always replaced by the
#string 'somefile' (note that the file annotated is specified below).
